An area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the effect's energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how to position its point of origin. If all straight lines extending from the point of origin to a location in the area of effect are blocked, that location isn't included in the area of effect. To block a line, an obstruction must provide Total Cover. If the creator of an area of effect places it at an unseen point and an obstruction—such as a wall—is between the creator and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of the obstruction."

Unequipping a weapon includes sheathing, stowing, or dropping it. Moving Between Attacks: If you move on your turn and have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that gives you more than one attack as part of the Attack action, you can use some or all of that movement to move between those attacks."

				"description": "Objects can be harmed by attacks and by some spells, using the rules below. If an object is exceedingly fragile, the DM may allow a creature to break it automatically with the Attack or Utilize action. Armor Class: The Object Armor Class table suggests ACs for various substances. Object Armor Class: AC 11 Cloth, paper, rope; AC 13 Crystal, glass, ice; AC 15 Wood; AC 17 Stone; AC 19 Iron, steel; AC 21 Mithral; AC 23 Adamantite. Hit Points: An object is destroyed when it has 0 Hit Points. The Object Hit Points table suggests Hit Points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller. To track Hit Points for a Huge or Gargantuan object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section's Hit Points separately. The DM determines whether destroying part of an object causes the whole thing to collapse. Object Hit Points: Size Tiny (bottle, lock) Fragile 2 (1d4) Resilient 5 (2d4); Size Small (chest, lute) Fragile 3 (1d6) Resilient 10 (3d6); Size Medium (barrel, chandelier) Fragile 4 (1d8) Resilient 18 (4d8); Size Large (cart, dining table) Fragile 5 (1d10) Resilient 27 (5d10). Damage Types and Objects: Objects have Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. The DM might decide that some damage types are more or less effective against an object. For example, Bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting. Paper or cloth objects might have Vulnerability to Fire damage. Damage Threshold: Big objects, such as castle walls, often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. No Ability Scores: An object lacks ability scores unless a rule assigns scores to the object. Without ability scores, an object can't make ability checks, and it fails all saving throws."

You lose Concentration on an effect the moment you start casting a spell that requires Concentration or activate another effect that requires Concentration. Damage.

Special Speeds: Some creatures have special speeds, such as a Burrow Speed, Climb Speed, Fly Speed, or Swim Speed, each of which is defined in this glossary. If you have more than one speed, choose which one to use when you move; you can switch between the speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move. For example, if you have a Speed of 30 and a Fly Speed of 40, you could fly 10 feet, walk 10 feet, and leap into the air to fly 20 feet more. Changes to Your Speeds: If an effect increases or decreases your Speed for a time, any special speed you have increases or decreases by an equal amount for the same duration. For example, if your Speed is reduced to 0 and you have a Climb Speed, your Climb Speed is also reduced to 0. Similarly, if your Speed is halved and you have a Fly Speed, your Fly Speed is also halved."

In parentheses after the Hit Points, the monster's Hit Point Dice are provided, along with the contribution of its Constitution, if any, to its Hit Points. Following the Initiative modifier is an Initiative score. Some creatures that are created by magic lack Hit Dice and Initiative information. Speed: Here the monster's Speed is provided, along with any special speeds. Ability Scores: A table provides the monster's ability scores, modifiers, and saving throw modifiers, all of which are detailed in chapter 1. Skills: This entry lists the monster's skill proficiencies, if any. Resistances and Vulnerabilities: These entries list the monster's Resistances and Vulnerabilities, if any. Immunities: This section lists the monster's damage and condition Immunities, if any. Gear: If the monster has any equipment that can be given away or retrieved, it's listed in this entry. Senses: This entry lists the monster's special senses, such as Darkvision, and its Passive Perception. Languages: This entry lists any languages the monster knows. CR: Challenge Rating summarizes the threat a monster poses and is detailed in the Monster Manual. The Experience Points characters receive for defeating a monster and its Proficiency Bonus follow. Some creatures that are created by magic have no CR. Traits: The monster's traits, if any, are features that are active at all times or in certain situations. Actions: The monster can take these actions in addition to those detailed in this glossary. Bonus Actions: If the monster has Bonus Action options, they are listed in this section. Reactions: If the monster can take special Reactions, those are listed in this section. Attack Notation: The entry for a monster's attack starts by identifying whether the attack is a melee or a ranged attack and then provides the attack roll's bonus, its reach or range, and what happens on a hit. An attack is against one target unless its entry says otherwise. Saving Throw Effect Notation: If an effect forces a saving throw, the effect's entry starts by identifying the kind of saving throw required and then provides the save's DC, a description of which creatures must make the save, and what happens on a failed or a successful save. Damage Notation: A stat block usually provides both a static number and a die expression for each instance of damage. For example, an attack might deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a hit. The DM determines whether you use the static number or the die expression in parentheses; you don't use both."
